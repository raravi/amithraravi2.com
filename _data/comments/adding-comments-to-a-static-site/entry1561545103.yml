message: "Hi Amith,\r\n\r\nthanks for the post which was very interesting because I wanna drive away from Wordpress and upload my static site (just plain HTML/CSS files). The biggest challenge for me (I am a rank beginner in JS) is to integrate comments (without 3d party solutions). They say one can use PHP or JavaScript for that, right?\r\n\r\nDo you know an elegant way to build comments code with Javascript or PHP? Maybe you have an additional advice for me?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,  \r\nJaroslav aka JP"
