It has finally happened, I've moved to a place which I can call my own. It's a sweet feeling!

It's difficult to think of moving away from a locality where you have lived for ever. That's what holds you back - the familiarity. All you have to do is take that first step, get that nudge out of the door. After that it's sailing, definitely not smooth though :)

The incredible feeling of first-time ownership of Home can only be understood by people who have been living in rented spaces all their life. And that's what we need to keep in mind. The excitement of something new! It should scare you as much as it excites you.

Through all the confusion of moving to & setting up my new home, there was only one central thought - **Movement**. There is only so much you can plan on - all I remember now is I decided to call the *Movers & Packers* for a particular date. That started the ball rolling!

This *[article](https://m.signalvnoise.com/planning-is-guessing-66fd2cea3f50)* on **Medium** says it all about planning :)

After that, it's all a blur. It's a continuous procession of people, of fixing up stuff and of putting things inside cabinets. Yet, the excitement I had on the day when I moved in is still here, a week after the move. It still makes me smile.

Here's to many more new things to be experienced and wisdom gained (hopefully :-P)!!
