Well, I've bought my own domain folks! I'm all set to start on my journey of getting to know basics of web development & use that to build my own beautiful web space. And start getting clients so that I can build them quality websites as per their requirements.

{% include toc.html %}

## What am I

I've been working in IT industry for over 8 years now. I have had extensive experience in client-facing roles and I mean to leverage that to work with my future clients to ensure their total satisfaction with the product delivered.

I am well versed in the art of maintining good relationship with the clients and have them tell me what exactly are their expectations at every point from start to the delivery of the product. Since I did manage small teams of 6-10 people starting in my last 3 years of work, I know the complexities involved in getting the requirements converted into well-defined tasks which can be done in a finite time.

## Where Am I

I'm here to learn & use what I learn to keep growing! I want to have a detailed understanding of HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Javascript, RESTful APIs, node.js, angular.js, REACT and use them to build beautiful websites.

My aim is to be a Full Stack Web Developer by the first half of 2017. You can call this website my mission statement!

## What Next

I'll share blog articles on my experience setting up everything - from buying a web domain to setting up web hosting. I'll also blog on the technologies I've learnt so that it can be useful to people who are new to them, as I know how difficult it is to start looking for resources that give a complete picture.

So here we go!
