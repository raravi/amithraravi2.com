I've accumulated more than 10 years of Information Technology experience, working mainly in client-facing roles with teams of 6-10 people, handling the complexities involved in getting the requirements converted into well-defined tasks.

## Freelancing

My freelancing career took off in the beginning of 2017, with focus on **Web Design** and **Content Creation**. I'm actively involved in learning new technologies like Node.js, AngularJS, Static Site Generators (Jekyll, Gatsby), ReactJS, React Native. And I do love a good story, which compels me to read. A lot. I go through at least 100 books in a year. Hence, my passion for the <u>written word</u>!

## Personal Life

I love going on trips to places where the mobile network cannot reach, and documenting it on Instagram/Medium. Spend most of my spare time with family. And reading novels. And watching movies. Have I mentioned _The White Wizard_ yet..?!
