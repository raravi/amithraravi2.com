## CSS Custom Variables

Before using custom variables, the color properties (of various backgrounds, of different fonts) were spread all over the CSS file. CSS custom properties allows for a central location to be established. This helps keep the CSS dry (Don't Repeat Yourself)!

## Media queries

Media Queries help a website to become responsive and present itself to the user based on the device display specifications. Smaller and a more compact version on a smaller screen? Yes, you can do that!
