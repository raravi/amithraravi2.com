# Amith Raravi's Blog - Version 2.0

My Personal Website

This will hold the code of my website www.amithraravi.com, so that i don't accidentally delete it. I may need help from other contributors later on - once my website grows - hence creating a repo to track the changes.

This is a work in progress. Just a little something I’m using to jump start a career refresh :)

I like to think of it as a starter for building my freelancing work…
