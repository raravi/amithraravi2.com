This project is written to highlight the differences between ES5 / ES6 code. And provide an easy reference to refactor the same app into MVC pattern. It is motivated by [todomvc](http://todomvc.com), and conducted as an exercise to understand the differences of each method followed.

For all methods,
* **Semantic HTML** elements used for better organization of code.
* [BEM](http://getbem.com/) used to write CSS. **BEM** helped to incorporate changes to the design of the app with minimal updates to the CSS.

## Method 1: ES5

The first iteration was used to get Todo app working as fast as possible. The javascript was written in classical style. There is no separation of **UI/Business Logic/Data**.

## Method 2: ES6

Using ES6 features led to cleaner code.
* `const / let` instead of `var` variables.
* `for..of` loop is more natural.
* arrow functions don't need `this` to be set separately.
* spread operator makes life much easier :)

## Method 3: MVC pattern

Refactoring the code to be written in MVC requires quite a bit of boilerplate. But it makes writing code easier!
* The focus is adding each functionality one after the other.
* Thinking in terms of what each part handles (Model, View, Controller) reduced errors.
* When errors cropped up, they were far easier to debug than in the previous approaches!
* Maintainable code.

## ES5 transpiled

This folder contains the transpiled output of the ES6 Javascript code. It is generated to understand the performance of transpiled code on older browsers.

* Does the transpilation add too much extra code for it to be not useful?
* Which ES6 features add the most code?

By knowing these, we get an idea of the benefits of using ES6 features too!
